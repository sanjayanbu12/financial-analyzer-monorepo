Enterprise-Grade Financial Document AnalyzerThis is the refactored, production-ready version of the Financial Document Analyzer. The original prototype has been completely rebuilt to address critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and architectural flaws.Project StructureThe project is organized into a monorepo structure with distinct frontend and backend applications./

Key Architectural Decisions & Refactoring Highlights1.  Backend (FastAPI)Modular Architecture: The backend is structured into modules (api, core, db, services, crew) for better separation of concerns and maintainability.Asynchronous Operations: The entire stack, from API endpoints to database interactions (motor), is asynchronous to handle concurrent requests efficiently.Background Task Processing: The long-running CrewAI analysis is offloaded to a Celery worker with Redis as the message broker. The API now immediately returns a task ID, preventing request timeouts and allowing the frontend to poll for status updates.Database Integration (MongoDB): MongoDB is used for storing user data, document metadata, and analysis results. GridFS is used for storing the uploaded PDF files, keeping all data within the database ecosystem.Authentication & Security: Implemented robust JWT-based authentication with python-jose and passlib. API endpoints are protected, and user roles can be easily added. Security headers and proper exception handling are in place.Configuration Management: Centralized configuration using Pydantic's BaseSettings, loading sensitive data from environment variables (.env file).Refactored CrewAI Agents & Tasks:The nonsensical and unprofessional prompts have been completely rewritten to perform a genuine, high-quality financial analysis.A structured, multi-agent workflow is now established for validating, extracting, analyzing, and reporting on the document.Robust Tools: The broken PDF tool has been replaced with a functional one using PyPDFLoader from LangChain, integrated properly as a crewai-tool.2.  Frontend (React)Modern Tooling: Built with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS for a fast development experience and a modern, responsive UI.Component-Based Architecture: The UI is broken down into reusable components for authentication, file uploads, dashboard views, and displaying analysis results.State Management: React Context is used for managing global state, such as user authentication status.API Integration: axios is used for seamless communication with the backend, including interceptors to automatically attach JWT tokens to authenticated requests.User Experience: The application provides real-time feedback with loading spinners, progress bars for uploads, and status polling for the analysis process. Final reports are rendered from Markdown for easy readability.3.  Production Readiness & DevOpsContainerization: Dockerfile for the backend and a docker-compose.yml file are provided to orchestrate the entire application stack (FastAPI, React, Celery, Redis, MongoDB), ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.CI/CD Ready: The containerized setup makes the application easy to integrate into any modern CI/CD pipeline.Scalability: The combination of an async backend, background workers, and a robust database makes the system horizontally scalable to handle increased load.This refactored system is now stable, secure, and built on an enterprise-grade foundation.
